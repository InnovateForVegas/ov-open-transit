# Open Transit Controller Tools

We assume that a *Public Transit Controller* (Operations Staff) is overseeing day-to-day functionality of individual vehicles, aggregate grid performance over particular time intervals, real-time route changes due to detour, traffic delays, rider services, rider issues, and so on.

## Highest Priority Considerations

The ability to access current information from multiple sources and provide a nearly-real-time situation update to any Controller is paramount. Any Controller may need to re-route one or more vehicles, receive information that one or more vehicles have been re-routed due to real-time circumstances, receive information concerning equipment failures or collisions or other route failures, information about shared bike failures or thefts, rider issuesâ€¦ as such, the interfaces for the Controller Client should be optimized for particular situational awareness and render data accordingly.
