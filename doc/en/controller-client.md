# Open Transit Controller Tools

We assume that a *Public Transit Controller* (Operations Staff) is overseeing day-to-day functionality of individual vehicles, aggregate grid performance over particular time intervals, real-time route changes due to detour, traffic delays, rider services, rider issues, and so on.

## Highest Priority Considerations

The ability to access current information from multiple sources and provide a nearly-real-time situation update to any Controller is paramount. Any Controller may need to re-route one or more vehicles, receive information that one or more vehicles have been re-routed due to real-time circumstances, receive information concerning equipment failures or collisions or other route failures, information about shared bike failures or thefts, rider issuesâ€¦ as such, the interfaces for the Controller Client should be optimized for particular situational awareness and render data accordingly.

## User Stories

Individual stories may be converted into Issues, or consolidated or exploded as needed for development and implementation.

**Terms**:

- **Consumer**: a bus rider, bike share user, and so on.
- **Operator**: a bus driver, and so on.
- **Controller**: a transit operations staff member, and so on.
- **Company**: a transit company, commission, or other agency overseeing transit services

### Typical Uses

- **Card**: As a Controller, I need to know the status (location, velocity, capacity) of each vehicle and to see or hear that information in usable and adjustable ways.
  - **Conversation**: A Controller overseeing an operating transit environment must be able to observe all observable data in totality or in faceted or factored views to focus on particular to drill down into a particular situation or scenario.
  - **Confirmation**:
    - Controller is able to observe real time data from Real Time Server, feedback from Consumer Server, and status indicators from Operators to assess a current high level transit status.\
    - Controller is able to observe a single vehicle, single stop, single map grid, and so on for more focused and detailed assessments.
