# Open Transit Overview

This Overview repository is a specification and documentation component of the Open Transit Project. Please do not add code or other resources to this repository.

The goal of this project is to enable development of practical applications of public transit data tied to physical transit systems at city scale.

Open Data should be captured and stored in meaningfully-segregated tables, using geographical information systems (GIS) best practices wherever possible, or enabling equivalent best practice access and manipulation.

Ultimately the goal of this project is to develop a functional transit platform that serves consumers of transit services (riders of buses, bikes, etc), operators of transit services (bus drivers, maintenance personnel et al.) and controllers (operations staff overseeing transit system flow and function). Making use of real time data for planning transit trips in the present time, and capturing and using data for continuous improvement and evaluation of the transit system on the whole from a variety of perspectives.

## Project Policies

Unless otherwise and specifically indicated with replacement files in this repository, this project will adhere to the default Innovate for Vegas Foundation policies for Code of Conduct and Contributing, found at

## General Focus Areas

This is a large project with multiple components. There are existing tools, protocols, and data formats already in use based on open standards and proprietary applications, the aim is to augment and, eventually, replace these proprietary applications with options developed locally.

## Specification Documents

The specification(s) for the various components and goals of this project are located in the [Doc](doc/README.md) directory. Note that there should be localized versions of the specification documents as needed in this subdirectory.

## Project Backlog

As this project adds component repositories, specific GitHub issues may be opened against individual repos for relevant bugs, missing features, and so on. Prior to the relevant repository existing, an issue backlog may be created against this overview repository. When an appropriate component repository has been created, an issue may be created against the repository with a reference to the issue opened against this overview repository (Double-linking is encouraged).
